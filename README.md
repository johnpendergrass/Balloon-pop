## Overview

TSBalloonie is a complete, polished HTML5 balloon popping game with a delightful Toy Story theme. Originally started as "Balloon-pop" on August 18, 2025, it was renamed to TSBalloonie on August 19, 2025 to better reflect its whimsical Toy Story theming.

The entire game was developed using Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant) and represents a fully-featured browser-based game with professional-quality gameplay mechanics, animations, and sound.

## Quick Start

1. **Download or clone this repository**
2. **Open `TSBalloonie.html` in your web browser** 
3. **Start playing immediately!**

Alternative files to run:
- `index.html` (if present) 
- `TSBalloonie.html` ‚Üê **Main game file**

**That's it!** Everything needed is contained in the single HTML file.

***** NOTE: these assets files are also used in the game:

   --BG-1.png, BG-2.png, BG-3.png, BG-4.png, BG-5.png
   --TSBalloonie-background.png
   --TSBalloonie-logo.png
   --Buzz-01.mp3, Buzz-02.mp3, Buzz-03.mp3
   --Fanfare-01.mp3

I think the game will run without these assets present, but have not tested it.

### üéØ Advanced Start Options

**Start at Any Level**: Add `?level=X` to the URL to start at a specific level (1-10)
```
TSBalloonie.html?level=5        # Start at level 5
TSBalloonie.html?level=8        # Start at level 8
```

**Debug Mode**: Add `?level=X&score=Y` for testing with custom starting scores
```
TSBalloonie.html?level=5&score=1000000     # Level 5 with 1 million points
TSBalloonie.html?level=8&score=50000000    # Level 8 with 50 million points
```
