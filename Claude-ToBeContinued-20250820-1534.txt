TSBalloonie Project - Detailed Summary
Generated: 2025-08-20 15:34
Status: CRITICAL ISSUES - Game partially broken, needs immediate fixes

=== PROJECT OVERVIEW ===
TSBalloonie.html - A sophisticated HTML5 Canvas balloon popping game with slot machine-style scoring.
Single-file architecture (2500+ lines) combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy distribution.

** CRITICAL STATUS: Game has 3 major broken functionalities that prevent normal operation **
1. Start button non-functional
2. Top score display invisible 
3. Custom cursor only visible over specific elements

=== CURRENT FEATURES (When Working) ===

Core Gameplay:
- 10-level progression system with increasing difficulty
- Level 1: 10 balloons (40-60px radius), Level 10: 20 balloons (15-35px radius)
- 20-second timer per level, +1 second per balloon popped
- Balloon physics with collision detection and realistic bouncing
- Custom wavy strings with varied colors
- Numbered balloon sequence system with exponential bonus scoring

Scoring System:
- Base points: 10^(level-1) (1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.)
- Streak system: 5+ consecutive hits get 10x level points bonus
- Miss resets streak to 0
- Sequence bonuses for numbered balloons hit in order
- Total score tracking with slot machine display (currently invisible)

Visual Systems:
- Slot machine-style score display at top (HTML/CSS exists but not visible)
- Custom cursor with streak indicator (visibility broken)
- Dynamic background system (auto-discovers BG-1.png through BG-20.png)
- Starfield fallback when no background images available
- Chrome-style separator with animated shine effect
- Top timer with color coding (green/yellow/red based on remaining time)

NEW UI Systems (Completed This Session):
- Comprehensive Game Summary box with detailed level and game statistics
- Bottom-left leaderboard display (Toy Story chrome style)
- Game-level statistics tracking (total balloons, longest streak, game time)
- Enhanced summary content with proper formatting and dividers

=== CRITICAL ISSUES (IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED) ===

Issue 1: Start Button Completely Non-Functional
- Button: "Launch Next Level ➤" in #levelStart container
- HTML: <button id="startButton" onclick="startLevel()">Launch Next Level ➤</button>
- Function exists: startLevel() calls startGame() which calls gameLoop()
- Problem: Button click appears to do nothing, game never starts
- Investigation: applyBackgroundImage() function exists, so not missing function issue
- Attempted Fix: Removed hideGameUI() call that was undefined
- Status: Still broken after attempted fixes

Issue 2: Top Score Display Invisible
- HTML Structure: #scoreboardArea > #slotMachineDisplay > #scoreDigits
- CSS: Proper styling exists for slot machine display
- Functions Added: initializeScoreDisplay(), updateSlotMachineDisplay()
- Problem: Score panel at top of screen not visible despite all elements present
- Investigation: HTML exists, CSS exists, JavaScript functions added
- Status: Score counter missing from game display

Issue 3: Custom Cursor Visibility Problems  
- Expected: Custom cursor visible everywhere on page
- Actual: Cursor only visible when hovering over buttons or text
- Changes Made: Added global cursor: none, removed conflicting enter/leave handlers
- Problem: Cursor disappears over canvas and background areas
- Status: Partial fix, still not working as expected

=== RECENT CHANGES (This Session) ===

Major UI Redesign (Successfully Completed):
- Renamed levelSummary to gameSummary throughout codebase

- updateSlotMachineDisplay() - Update score display (not working)

PARTIAL - Cursor Functions:
- updateCursor() - Update cursor based on streak (working)
- handleMouseMove() - Track mouse position (working)
- Removed handleMouseEnter/Leave (causing conflicts)

=== NEXT STEPS (Priority Order) ===

IMMEDIATE (Session 1):
1. **Fix Start Button Functionality** - CRITICAL
   - Debug why startLevel() isn't being called from button click
   - Check for JavaScript errors preventing execution
   - Verify DOM readiness and event binding
   - Test direct function calls from console

2. **Restore Top Score Panel Visibility** - CRITICAL  
   - Investigate why #scoreDigits is not visible
   - Check CSS display properties and z-index
   - Verify scoreDigitsElement DOM reference
   - Test updateSlotMachineDisplay() functionality

3. **Fix Custom Cursor Global Visibility** - HIGH
   - Resolve cursor: none conflicts
   - Ensure custom cursor tracks properly across entire page
   - Test cursor visibility over canvas and all areas

SHORT TERM (Session 2):
4. Validate complete game flow from start to finish
5. Test new gameSummary display functionality
6. Test leaderboard system integration
7. Verify all new statistics tracking works correctly

MEDIUM TERM:
8. Enhance score display with original slot machine animations
9. Add sound effects and additional polish
10. Implement celebration system for milestones

=== CODE STRUCTURE HIGHLIGHTS ===

NEW: Game Summary System (lines ~920-970):
- Comprehensive HTML structure with proper semantic organization
- CSS styling with section labels and visual hierarchy  
- JavaScript integration with scoring and timing systems

NEW: Leaderboard System (lines ~946-978):
- Bottom-left positioning with Toy Story chrome styling
- Integrated with localStorage persistence
- Proper control buttons for user interaction

MODIFIED: Cursor System (lines ~90-98, ~2050-2070):
- Global cursor: none applied to body
- Custom cursor with updated event handling
- Removed conflicting enter/leave handlers

ADDED: Score Display Functions (lines ~2058-2070):
- Basic score initialization and update functions
- Integration points for slot machine display
- Placeholder for more sophisticated animations

Original Core Systems (preserved):
- Game variables and DOM references (lines ~990-1020)
- Background image management (lines ~1140-1250)
- Balloon class and physics (lines ~1300-1620)
- Game loop and timing (lines ~1625-1650)
- Event handlers and input (lines ~2140-2200)

=== TECHNICAL NOTES FOR CONTINUATION ===

Critical Investigation Needed:
1. **Start Button**: onclick="startLevel()" attribute exists, function exists, but no execution
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify DOM loading timing
   - Test direct function calls: window.startLevel()

2. **Score Display**: All components exist but invisible
   - HTML: <div id="scoreDigits"></div> in #slotMachineDisplay
   - CSS: #scoreDigits styling applied
   - JS: scoreDigitsElement reference and update function
   - Check: display properties, z-index, text content

3. **Cursor System**: Global cursor: none vs element-specific visibility
   - Body has cursor: none
   - Elements have cursor: pointer !important
   - Custom cursor positioned but visibility issues
   - Check: global positioning, z-index conflicts

Game State on Session End:
- currentLevel: 1 (default)
- currentScore: 0 (default)  
- gameRunning: false (expected)
- waitingForStart: true (expected)
- All new UI elements created but game inaccessible

Success Markers for Next Session:
- Start button successfully launches game
- Score display visible and updating
- Custom cursor visible across entire page
- Complete game flow functional
- New summary and leaderboard systems tested

This file serves as a comprehensive guide for immediate debugging and continuation of the TSBalloonie project.
