TSBalloonie Project - Detailed Summary

Status: Milestone celebrations removed, ready for new celebration system

=== PROJECT OVERVIEW ===
TSBalloonie.html - A sophisticated HTML5 Canvas balloon popping game with slot machine-style scoring.
Single-file architecture (2000+ lines) combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy distribution.

=== CURRENT FEATURES ===

Core Gameplay:
- 10-level progression system with increasing difficulty
- Level 1: 10 balloons (40-60px radius), Level 10: 20 balloons (15-35px radius)
- 20-second timer per level, +1 second per balloon popped
- Balloon physics with collision detection and realistic bouncing
- Custom wavy strings with varied colors

Scoring System:
- Base points: 10^(level-1) (1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.)
- Streak system: 5+ consecutive hits get 10x level points bonus
- Miss resets streak to 0
- Total score tracking with slot machine display

Visual Systems:
- Slot machine-style rolling number display (15 digits, handles up to 999 trillion)
- Custom cursor with streak indicator (shows streak number when 5+)
- Dynamic background system (auto-discovers BG-1.png through BG-20.png)
- Starfield fallback when no background images available
- Chrome-style separator with animated shine effect
- Top timer with color coding (green/yellow/red based on remaining time)

=== TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE ===

Canvas System:
- DPR (Device Pixel Ratio) scaling for high-resolution displays
- Canvas resizing with proper coordinate transformation
- Physics engine with elastic collisions between balloons
- CSS pixel coordinate system with proper bounds checking

Background Management:
- Dynamic discovery system tests for BG-1.png through BG-20.png
- Random background selection per level
- Graceful fallback to animated starfield
- Background consistency maintained throughout each level

Slot Machine Display:
- 15 individual digit wheels with CSS transforms
- Rolling animation with overshoot and bounce-back effects
- Comma separators every 3 digits
- Cascading timing (right-most digits animate first)
- Handles score updates from any previous value to any new value

Data Persistence:
- localStorage for game statistics and leaderboard
- Top 5 games saved with score, level, balloons, time, streaks
- Total statistics across all games
- Automatic saving on game completion

=== KEY FUNCTIONS AND THEIR PURPOSES ===

Game Loop Functions:
- init() - Initialize game, discover backgrounds, setup displays
- startLevel() - Begin level with consistent background
- gameLoop() - Main animation loop with timing
- endGame() - Handle level completion/failure, advance levels

Scoring Functions:
- processHit() - Calculate points, update streak, add time
- processMiss() - Reset streak, record completed streaks
- updateScoreDisplay() - Update text displays
- updateSlotMachineDisplay() - Animate rolling numbers
- updateStreakDisplay() - Update streak counter with visual feedback

Balloon Management:
- Balloon class - Individual balloon with physics properties
- updateBalloons() - Physics updates and collision detection
- drawBalloons() - Render balloons with strings and highlights

Background System:
- discoverBackgroundImages() - Test for available background files
- applyBackgroundImage() - Load and apply background with fallback
- setRandomBackground() - Select random background for level

Display Systems:
- initializeScoreDisplay() - Create slot machine digit wheels
- rollDigit() - Animate individual digit with overshoot effect
- updateCursor() - Switch between normal and streak cursor
- updateTopTimer() - Update timer with color coding

=== DEBUGGING FEATURES ===

Cheat System:
- ALT-P during gameplay: Pop random balloon
- Function: cheatPopRandomBalloon()

URL Parameters:
- ?level=X - Start at specific level (1-10)
- ?score=Y - Start with specific score
- Example: TSBalloonie.html?level=5&score=1000000

Console Debug Functions:
- debugState() - Show current game state
- debugHit() - Simulate balloon hit
- debugMiss() - Simulate miss
- debugCheat() - Test ALT-P cheat manually
- debugUrlParams() - Show URL parameter info
- debugBackground(filename) - Test background loading
- debugHelp() - Show all debug commands

=== RECENT CHANGES (Session Summary) ===

Completed in Previous Session:
- Implemented ALT-P cheat key with proper game state checking
- Built comprehensive slot machine scoring display
- Enhanced mouse cursor to show streak numbers
- Added URL parameter debugging system
- Implemented sophisticated background discovery and management

Just Completed (Current Session):
- REMOVED all milestone celebration code:
  * Deleted celebration CSS (.celebration-container, .sparkle, @keyframes)
  * Removed celebration HTML container
  * Deleted checkMilestones() function
  * Removed triggerCelebration(), createSparkle(), flashMainDisplay()
  * Cleaned up all celebration-related variables and DOM references
- Scoring system now runs clean without any visual celebrations
- All other systems preserved and functional

=== CODE STRUCTURE HIGHLIGHTS ===

CSS Organization:
- Body and container styling (lines 8-30)
- Scoreboard area styling (lines 32-120)
- Game area and canvas styling (lines 70-88)
- Custom cursor system (lines 90-137)
- Slot machine display (lines 311-469)
- Timer styling with state changes (lines 378-394)

JavaScript Organization:
- Game variables and DOM references (lines 583-606)
- URL parameter debugging system (lines 648-719)
